      GitHub token to use for authentication when pulling and pushing to the
      GitHub instance defined by 'github-server-url'. By default this is unset.
      You can set this to 'github.token' or a personal access token if you want
      to configure GitHub authentication globally.
  github-server-url:
    description: >
      Server URL like 'https://github.example.org' to use as the scope for the
      'github-token'. By default this uses 'github.server_url' which is usually
      'https://github.com'. You shouldn't need to change this.
